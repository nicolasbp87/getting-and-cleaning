# Abstract
## Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

## Data Set Information:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

## About the data
In summary the data includes:

Train and Test Datasets - data from the experiment.

X_test.txt - observation

Y_test.txt - activity code

Features - column names for train and test dataset

Activity Labels - activity mapping

Please read ./data/README.txt for detailed information on the dataset

## Data Cleaning Steps
Join X_test & Y_test columns for each (train & test)

Join rows of train and test observations.

Assign columnnames for data on step#2 from features.txt:

But features.txt has duplicate records. Records were renamed to include X, Y and Z each:

fBodyAcc-bandsEnergy()-1,8 ------> 'X'

fBodyAcc-bandsEnergy()-1,8 ------> 'Y'

fBodyAcc-bandsEnergy()-1,8 ------> 'Z'

Filtered the columns that is a measurement on the mean and standard deviation

Export tidydata from previous steps. Please check tidydata1.csv

Get average of each measurement in tidydata1 by activity. Please check tidydata2.csv
